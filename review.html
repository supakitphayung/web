        <h2>CEDT</h2>
        <img src="https://cedtintern.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/assets/images/layout/cedt_logo.png" alt="">
        <p>The thing that I'm most proud of this year is that I became a student in Computer Engineering and Digital Technology at Chulalongkorn University. This achievement means a lot to me because I worked extremely hard to reach this point, and it has been a journey full of challenges, learning, and personal growth. The process wasn’t easy, but I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be part of this prestigious university and study a field that excites me. Now, I would like to share a review of my life after completing my first semester as a student here.
            Let me start by saying that before I joined CEDT (Computer Engineering and Digital Technology), I had almost no experience with coding or any technical skills related to the field. I had always been curious about technology, but I had never really dived deep into it before. Because of that, I was quite nervous when I started my studies. I thought that the program would stress me out a lot, and I wasn't sure if I could keep up with the demands. However, in reality, it wasn’t as difficult as I had imagined. The atmosphere was supportive, and my friends were a huge help. They guided me through all the challenges, answering my questions and helping me understand everything that I was confused about. I realized that having supportive friends is incredibly important, and I can confidently say that they were the key to helping me succeed in my first semester.
            Let me now review some of the subjects that I took during my first semester.</p>
            <section class="comprog">
                <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
                <p>Computer Programming is one of the fundamental subjects in the Computer Engineering program. For me, this subject wasn’t extremely hard, but it wasn’t entirely easy either. The difficulty wasn’t in the concepts themselves, but in the way the topics were taught and how we had to apply them in assignments and exercises. It took a lot of practice and time to really understand and be able to implement the concepts effectively. I learned that the key to doing well in this subject is to study hard, practice regularly, and complete a lot of exercises. The more you practice, the easier it becomes, and you’ll gradually get better at writing code. Overall, it was challenging but manageable, and I felt proud of the progress I made.</p>

            <section class="in2">
                <h3>Intro to CEDT</h3>
                <p>Introduction to CEDT is a subject that teaches the basics of the technology scope, providing a broad overview of what we will study throughout the course. It was a useful subject because it helped me understand the fundamental concepts that will be explored in more detail in later courses. For me, this subject wasn’t particularly difficult, but it was essential for understanding the overall direction of the program. The assignments for this subject were manageable, and as long as you completed all the tasks and participated in class, passing the course was relatively straightforward.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="diglo">
                <h3>Digital Logic</h3>
                <p>Digital Logic was a subject that I found to be really difficult. It involves understanding the core principles behind how digital circuits work, including logic gates, truth tables, and the design of circuits. What made this subject especially hard for me was the final project, where we were tasked with creating a mini CPU. It was an incredibly complex project, and I felt overwhelmed at times.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="discrete">
                <h3>Discrete Mathematics</h3>
                <p>Discrete Mathematics was my "safe zone" subject because it focused on mathematical concepts that are fundamental for coding and computer science. Topics like sets, logic, graph theory, and combinatorics are all very useful in programming and problem-solving. I enjoyed this subject because I have always liked math, and this subject gave me a solid foundation in mathematical thinking, which is essential for many other courses in the program. However, the subject had frequent tests, and what made it even more challenging was that the tests were in English.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="data">
                <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
                <p>Data Structures and Algorithms was by far the hardest subject in the first semester. In this course, we had to learn about different types of data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues) and algorithms (such as sorting and searching algorithms) in just 1 to 1.5 months. The speed at which we had to grasp these complex topics was intense, and the tests were always difficult. I often found myself thinking, “When did they withdraw this subject?” because it felt so overwhelming at times. However, despite the challenges, I knew that mastering data structures and algorithms is crucial for becoming a good computer engineer, so I pushed myself to understand the material as best as I could. The tests were tough, but the satisfaction of solving problems and understanding the concepts made it all worth it in the end.</p>

            <section class="conclusion">
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Fortunately, after all the hard work, I passed every subject 🥳🥳. This first semester of Computer Engineering and Digital Technology has been challenging, tiring, and at times stressful, but it has also been incredibly fun and exciting. I’ve learned so much already, and I am eager to continue learning more in the upcoming semesters. I’ve come to realize that the journey of earning this bachelor’s degree is not going to be easy, but it is going to be a rewarding and fulfilling one. I am grateful for the opportunity to be a student here at Chulalongkorn University, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come. I can’t wait to see what the future holds and to continue my studies in this field that I am so passionate about.
                    This year has been full of personal growth, and I’m excited to see where this journey will take me. I’m happy to be part of this program, and I look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead.
